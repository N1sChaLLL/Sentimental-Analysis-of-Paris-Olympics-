226,@adriennelowe8250,"Dearest Gentle Reader,
I m about to step on some toes in regard to the Opening Ceremony at the Paris Olympics.
The headless woman was Marie Antoinette. She ruled over France and was found guilty of treason, conspiracy, and stealing from the country.
Sound familiar?
Also, it was not the Last Supper. It was a depiction of an ancient Greek Bacchanal&  because, you know, the Olympics are ancient and Greek. Surprise!
And if you didn t know, a Bacchanalia is an uncontrollably promiscuous, extravagant, and loud party. The parties often spanned several days which honored the god of wine, Bacchus (the blue guy covered in grape vine). He is also known as Dionysus, the Greek god of fertility, later known as the god of wine and pleasure.
And finally, it was not Death on a pale horse. It was Sequana, Goddess of the Seine, the River in which the boat precession took place. She was meant to be the representation of the Olympic spirit and of Sequana.
If some of you weren t so busy trying to end the Dept. of Education, you might know this.
Loosen the clutch on your pearls.
Yours truly,
Lady Francis",negative,YouTube

306,@theilluminati2319,"The Paris Olympics opening ceremony on Friday was a bold and innovative celebration that transformed the city into a grand amphitheater, utilizing the Seine River as a stage for a parade of athletes from 205 countries. Despite the heavy rain, the event drew 300,000 on-site viewers, making it the largest in Olympic history. This ambitious approach showcased Paris' rich cultural heritage and its commitment to hosting a memorable and inclusive Olympic Games. The presence of global stars like Lady Gaga added a layer of glamour and excitement, resonating with audiences worldwide.

However, the ceremony was not without its controversies. Some acts sparked backlash on social media, reflecting the challenges of balancing creativity with cultural sensitivity and public opinion in such high-profile events. The decision to incorporate certain elements, though intended to be groundbreaking and thought-provoking, highlights the delicate line between artistic expression and respect for diverse perspectives.

The significance of hosting the ceremony on the Seine River cannot be overstated. It symbolized a merging of tradition and modernity, paying homage to the historical essence of Paris while embracing contemporary artistic innovation. This choice also underscored the importance of environmental consciousness, subtly aligning with global efforts to highlight the role of natural landscapes in urban settings.

While the heavy rain posed logistical challenges, it also added an element of unpredictability and resilience to the event. The athletes' and performers' perseverance in the face of adverse weather conditions was a testament to the Olympic spirit, demonstrating determination and unity.

In conclusion, the Paris Olympics opening ceremony was a monumental event that pushed the boundaries of what an Olympic opening ceremony can be. It served as a grand showcase of Paris' cultural and artistic prowess, though not without provoking critical discourse. The blending of tradition with contemporary elements, the significant use of the Seine River, and the handling of unexpected challenges collectively made it a historic and thought-provoking beginning to the Games.",positive,YouTube

Like I love cheering for my countrymen but the beauty of the games is that you get exposed to a lot of stuff that you usually don't get to see on TV. They show like one event involving Indians and then after that it's just a random discussion between the Indian broadcast team.

History in the sense of honoring very significant events in the major religions throughout time while, at the same time, honoring the beautiful, colorful culture that is so common now.

There is homosexuality throughout all of history and, especially in places like France and Spain, it has always been part of the culture.

Get away from your white-Jesus ideologies, recognize American Christianity often has adaptations and the evangelical folk that claim He will smite thee for just about anything, get your head out of your butt.

So I'm saying this with respect to everyone. This was not the time to put on this kind of display. It's about sports, it's not a Madonna concert. This is why a lot of the population feels like the LGBT agenda is being crammed down their throats. Even my bad son hates the bad scene. Obviously not all of it but the overly flamboyant and at times obnoxious displays. It's borderline ridiculous and offensive to the average person and even the average bad person, let alone to the average Christian. There are lots of other ways to win over the world. This ain't it.

However, before the 2008 Olympics, He’s age was reported by the Chinese press, including the state news service, Xinhua, as 13 in 2007 and 14 in 2008 in news articles[3][7][17][20] that were later taken off-line.[21][22] Her birth date has also been given on several registration lists of the General Administration of Sport in China, the Chengdu Sports Bureau and other registration sources as January 1, 1994, which would have made her 14 years, 220 days old during the opening ceremonies, and therefore too young to participate.[3][17][21][22] Chinese officials maintained that He was in fact old enough to compete, stating that Xinhua had not confirmed He’s age before filing their news reports[20] and attributing the discrepancies to faulty paperwork when He was transferred from Beijing to Hubei.[23] She herself, speaking to reporters after the 2008 Olympic team final, said, “My real age is 16. I don’t care what other people say.”[24][25] In another interview, she said, “I don’t get upset because I have answered this question many times. There’s no need to explain anymore.”[26] On August 2, the International Olympic Committee stated that it would not investigate the discrepancy in He’s reported age because the FIG’s own verification system was sufficient proof of eligibility. The FIG, in responding to the situation, said that it would not ask for additional proof of age beyond the passport already supplied by Chinese officials.[27][28]    However, the matter continued to be a source of controversy among members of the gymnastics community and the media.[21] The Times reported that a computer expert “Stryde” had recovered one of the deleted registration lists showing He’s birth date as January 1, 1994, through cached pages on the search engine Baidu.[29] On August 21, the IOC announced that it had asked the FIG to open an investigation into He and her teammates’ ages.[30] On August 22, 2008, the IOC said it had not uncovered any evidence of wrongdoing “so far” and expressed confidence that the Chinese Federation’s documents were correct.[31] However, the FIG held an emergency meeting about the situation on August 23 and requested additional documentation for every gymnast on the Chinese team, with the exception of Cheng Fei.[32][33] On August 24, a Chinese official addressed the registration lists found online, stating that the discrepancy was due to an administrative error that took place when He was transferred between teams while participating in the InterCity Games in 2007.[34]    On October 1, 2008, the FIG concluded its investigation, finding that He and her Olympic teammates were old enough to compete,[35] although some international media outlets remained skeptical”        They did multiple investigations already and the athletes themselves have come and out reaffirmed their age many times and no one who knows them has actually come out with proof and considering how big China is and that in the 90s and 2000s it was pretty much a developing country where  official paperwork is a mess    paperwork is still ass in china today), i think we can give them the benefit of the doubt.',)",Neutral,Reddit

It\'s one of the few ways to do it but Pinyin is the de facto system since China uses it and Taiwan switched to it in the 2000\'s.        The reason why ""ch"" is not used is that ""ch"" is actually another similar but distinct consonant. ""Qi"" and ""Chi"" would sound different    they sound a little similar but any mandarin speaker would be able to tell the difference). I think they couldn\'t find a good fit for this consonant and wanted to make sure it has a distinct representation to distinguish ""qin"" from ""cin"" and ""chin"" and just winged it and chose the most non-intuitive option for it…        I think ultimately it comes down to the fact that Pinyin was developed as a way for standardizing Chinese pronunciation representation within China, and therefore kind of mediocre as a tool to help non-Chinese speakers figure out how to pronounce it unless you learn a few specific rules like how to pronounce the ""q"".
